To test our code first start SimpleRegistryServer.

SimpleRegistryServer:
	java SimpleRegistryServer port

If no port is provided SimpleRegistryServer defaults to 15440

Then run yourRMI with the testProgram of choice, 
	the host and port of SimpleRegistryServer, 
	and an initial Service Name.
	
yourRMI:
	java yourRMI testProgram host port serviceName

(Note this has no defaults)
Our two provided test programs for yourRMI are ZipCodeServerImpl or ZipCodeRListImpl

Then run the client of that testProgram with the host and port of SimpleRegistryServer, 
	and the service name from yourRMI
	and an input file.

ZipCodeServerImpl:
	java ZipCodeClient host port serviceName file
ZipCodeRListImpl:
	java ZipCodeRListClient host port serviceName file

we have provided an input file ../a.txt for those 2 test programs.

We also have 4 files to test our SRS on its own.
SimpleRegistryServer must be running for these to work.

For Bind and Rebind you need the SRS host and port, a serviceName and the 4 arguments creating an RemoteObjectRef.
	Host (String)
	Port (int)
	ObjKey (int)
	Interface_Name (String)
testBind:
	java testBind host port serviceName IPAdr PortNum ObjKey InterfaceName
testRebind:
	java testRebind host port serviceName IPAdr PortNum ObjKey InterfaceName
(Note unless bind was applied to the serviceName these operate the same).

For Lookup and Unbind you need the SRS host and port, and a serviceName.
This serviceName should have already been bound (using one of the above).
testLookup:
	java testLookup host port serviceName
testUnbind:
	java testUnbind host port serviceName
