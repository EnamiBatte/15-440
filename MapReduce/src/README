Before compiling our code pick a master node and set it in the configuration file.
Also choose the slave nodes and for each node choose an associated  master listen port.

Then we have the number of lines to read at a time for map, and number of reducers and so on.

Once you are happy with that open a shell for each node you are using.

To run our code first run make all.
Then move to the build directory it created.

There you should see 2 files along with our compiled code.

On the master node run master/MasterController.
On each slave run slave/SlaveController.

Type start into the master node.

Now you should be able to add map-reduce jobs using the slave nodes.
Type start followed by one of our examples and the input file and what output files you want.

You should have 1 output file for each reducer you wish to run.

On the master you should also be able to run certain administrative commands

	print queue
		(Prints the current jobs in queue).
	print running
		(Prints the currently running jobs).
	print finished
		(Prints the currently finished jobs).
	kill (jid)
		(Kills the job identified by the job id)
	start
		(Starts the system anew should it go down).
		
As Examples to Run we have provided you with LetterCount and NumTimesLongest
To start these choose a slave and run:
	start example.LetterCount letter (output files...)
		(This will run LetterCount which counts the number of times each letter appears).
	start example.NumTimesLongest words (output files...)
		(This should output the longest word for each line and the number of times it was the longest word).
